# Music Release Tracker

A local-first desktop app that tracks new album and EP releases from artists you follow, powered by [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/).

![Dark themed UI with three tabs: Feed, Artists, and Check](https://img.shields.io/badge/theme-dark-1a1a2e) ![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-bb86fc) ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-03dac6)

## Features

- **Artist search** — find and add artists from MusicBrainz with disambiguation support
- **Release feed** — browse albums and EPs sorted by date, filter by artist, type, or new-only
- **New release detection** — "Check Now" scans all tracked artists and highlights newly discovered releases with a badge
- **Official releases only** — automatically filters out bootlegs, compilations, live albums, soundtracks, and remixes
- **Click-to-run** — auto-installs dependencies on first launch, no manual setup needed

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katemptiness110/music-release-tracker.git
cd music-release-tracker
python run.py
```

That's it. On first run it creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies automatically. Your browser opens to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Desktop Shortcut (optional)

To add the app to your application menu (Linux) or Desktop (Windows):

```bash
python create-shortcut.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Add artists** in the Artists tab — search by name, pick from results
2. **Check for new releases** in the Check tab — the app fetches release data from MusicBrainz with live progress
3. **Browse your feed** in the Feed tab — new releases are highlighted with a "NEW" badge; click to dismiss

When you first add an artist, all their existing releases are imported as "already seen" so your feed isn't flooded. Only releases discovered in subsequent checks are marked as new.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLite
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, dark theme
- **Data source:** [MusicBrainz API](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API) (no API key required)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Internet connection (for MusicBrainz API)

All Python dependencies are installed automatically by `run.py`.
